These are the routes which you will fing in this peoject ans their uses.

- /register => where you can register yourself as an employee 

- Note: Initially there will be only one admin and rest will register itself as employee 

when the admin verifies the employee then only it can login using the email and password
 
 - /dashboard =>  Once the employee login successsfully then according to their role will redirect to the dashboard

## Admin routes are
